<p>This morning I purchased Andy Carolan&#39;s <a
href="https://ko-fi.com/s/798b83fbcc">&quot;Powered by&quot; badge pack</a> for a
couple of bucks and love them so much! I love his style and design - my
current avatar is by him as well - and I wish I took the time to learn
icon design and he&#39;s definitely an inspiration. I want to get a custom
user icon but not sure what to request yet. maybe a DJ controller or
cute star since I love stars? Let me know what you think suits me.😄</p>

<p>My folks left after staying with me for the week. Love them to bits but
it&#39;s nice to have my space back haha. I&#39;m grateful for them either way.
I&#39;m already feeling really good and getting stronger each day, and my
incisions are healing nicely. I plan on setting up for a stream this
week since I miss it - some lovely people show up and I always look
forward to chatting with them!</p>

<p>Tonight my boyfriend and I are going to visit revolving sushi for dinner
which is a fave of ours. I love the garlic ponzu salmon sushi, tekka
maki, and taiyaki ice cream for dessert 🍣🤤</p>
