 <p>It&#39;s going to be one of those days. Anixety tends to creep in during PMS
and also since my surgery is next week my nerves get the best of me.
(I&#39;m getting a cyst in my ovary and possibly the ovary removed.) I know
everything will go fine, just one of those things where fear creeps in
thinking of all the things that could go wrong even with the smallest
chance. I&#39;ve never really had surgery other than when I was a teen for
something small.<br /><br />Send good vibes, prayers, and all the nice
things my way! Photos of cute animals encouraged. üòÜ</p>
