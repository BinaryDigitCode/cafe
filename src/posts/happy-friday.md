<p>It&#39;s the end of the week and I&#39;m feeling pretty good today! My muscle
soreness is finally better, and I&#39;m more mobile that yesterday. My mind
is very awake since I&#39;ve had a lot of sleep, and I need to remember to
not do too much physically üòÜ. I caught up on most of my work, and now
the weekend is beginning. I don&#39;t really know what to do with myself
since my parents will be in town for another day and I&#39;ll try to enjoy
their company.¬†</p>

<p>It&#39;s been kind of nice not being on the computer too much. I&#39;m excited
to get back to the things I enjoy even so, such as fiddling with my
website, fiddling with my stream setup, and planning to go live sometime
next week. I miss playing my music and playing games at night with my
buddies. I snuck in a game or two at lunch which was lovely since I
caught up with everyone. My boyfriend and I have a small circle of
friends in discord and it&#39;s been a wonderful community.¬†</p>

<p>Time to plan for dinner soon - tacos maybe? Yeah ü•≥</p>
