Today I had my performance review, which was probably the best one I've ever had. The most profound things I took away from it were that I still need to work on my confidence at work, as well as ask for help when I feel overwhelmped. I have a fancy title, and I should act like that title. I'm sure there's a deeper reason for why I don't do so, but life is always a learning lesson!

I wrote down my manager's quotes:

>"What evidence is out there that is making you question your worth?"

>"Seperate fact from what your mind is telling you!"

>"Say you're an expert every morning and BELIEVE it".


It's all about conviction and manifestation. Take the days that I feel this way, and make sure to exclaim it on the days that I don't.

I hope this speaks to you as well. 👏🏽
