<p><strong>What is &quot;My Family Case Exhibition&#39;&quot;?<br /></strong><br />&quot;<a
href="https://famicase.com/archives/index.html">My Family Case
Exhibition</a>&#39;&quot; started in 2005 as an exhibition event where creators
from various professions designed Family Case Labels on canvas. Since
then, it has been held as an annual event in May during Golden Week
every year, and this year marks the 20th time (2024). This exhibition
was started by 23 volunteers with connections to <a
href="https://super-meteor.com/">METEOR</a> , which is also the
exhibition venue , and the number of participants has increased each
time, and since the 2010 exhibition, works have been solicited from the
general public in addition to invited artists. To date, more than 100
creators from Japan, Europe, Asia, America, and other countries have
participated. The total number of works released so far is 3,035
(2005-2023).</p>

<p>This is SO cool! </p>
