<p>I&#39;ve wanted to stream more on Twitch, but sometimes it&#39;s alot of effort
to go downstairs to stand for hours and work with my lights and dual
computer setup. It&#39;s also dark and cold, and more often than not I like
sitting at my desk in the daylight and brightness with the pups in my
room. <br /><br />Now that the weather is getting really nice, I&#39;d love
to start doing more streams outside in the backyard as well as the
office. After doing some research I went with Native Instrument&#39;s
Traktor Kontrol S2 Mark 3 board! It&#39;s 2 channels, awesome build quality,
mic mute, and comes with Traktor Pro as well as DJ 2 so that I can use
either &quot;pro&quot; or &quot;regular&quot; software already included! I love Virtual DJ
(more than Recordbox) but would need to buy another license, and really
like the layout of the Traktor software so I&#39;ll give it a try first.<br
/><br />It&#39;s amazing how it&#39;s half of the price of my &quot;beginner&quot; board
(the DDJ-FLX6) and feels more awesome and compact. I&#39;m learning that
just because a brand is &quot;industry standard&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you need it for
a hobby.  </p>
