<p>Today we had a lovely day. We went to eat hot pot &amp; Korean bbq, then
saw Furiosa at the theater. I really liked that you got to see her
backstory. I  liked the first movie’s special effects more, but this
prequels story telling. </p>

<p>Tomorrow I hope to clean up the house a bit since it’s been a mess from
when my parents were in town. I’m feeling 95% back to normal, I just
need to be careful not to lift anything or hurt my scars. We need to do
some errands and go grocery shopping. Monday would be nice to relax and
not doing anything other than play games and chill. </p>
