 <p>It&#39;s tough to write everyday for WeblogPoMo but I&#39;ve been busy with my
parents who are in town. I realize how exhausting it is to talk to them,
plan things, and be around them, but I&#39;m still grateful for the love.
It&#39;s good to acknowledge my needs even so, because in the past I
wouldn&#39;t know why I was so socially tired around them all the time. They
are excited to visited and are here to support me for my surgery
tomorrow. I can&#39;t wait for it to be over!</p>

<p>This past weekend they met my boyfriend&#39;s parents and sister, which was
a hit! I was so happy they were all chatting away getting to know each
other. We celebrated Mother&#39;s Day together with some food and cake. It
was also a gorgeous day out, with no clouds, all sun and warm weather,
and at my boyfriend&#39;s parents beautiful house on the water. It was a
lovely weekend.¬† üíñ</p>
