<p>It&#39;s always so scary trying to find a new set of doctors in a new town.
One thing I do know is trusting your instinct is KEY, and I&#39;m glad I
did. After nearly a year of deciding to get surgery to remove my ovarian
blood cyst out in New York (my home state that¬† visit frequently to see
family) or Michigan (where I currently live), I decided to do it here in
Michigan, and found an amazing set of doctors - from internal, to gyn,
to surgeon. Im so grateful that I trusted my instinct and after looking
for 3 doctors I found all the ones that worked out wonderfully. Today is
the day after surgery and I&#39;m feeling pretty good! I just have some
soreness in my abdomen where the robot did it&#39;s thing. Five small
incisions and nothing more. Incredible. Meds in case of pain, but I was
able to sleep throughout the night without the meds. Honestly it&#39;s no
worse than a normal menstral day lol.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone sending love and support! It means the world to
me. üíñü•∞</p>
