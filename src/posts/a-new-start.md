# Version 3 of the Cafe

![Hello Again graphic](/src/assets/img/feature-imgs/helloagain.png)

It should come to no surprise that I've tinkered yet again and have converted my website to something new. Welcome to *version 3* of the cafe!

I haven't been up to many projects or hobbies lately, but I find that fiddling with my website is somehow theraputic. I love learning new things, and since I've been around on Mastodon for a while, I follow many developers, artists, and creative folks that I admire and get inspiration from. 

I really enjoyed my old site using Hugo and Blowfish - which is the most amazing template for Hugo, but I really wanted to give Eleventy a go due to the incredible customization of it all. 

I would like to make this a home to post about what I'm up to, and have set the site to be able to post and cross post various ways that is incredibly cool. 

- I was able to set up DecapCMS since it came configured with this theme!
- I'm able to cross post from a [Scribbles](https://scribbles.page) blog to this site using [Echofeed.app](https://echofeed.app)!
- I can still create a markdown post via a code editor as usual
- Many more customizations to go

Do what makes you happy with your own website, amiright? ðŸ˜†
